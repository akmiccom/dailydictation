Excuse me. I'm trying to find the nearest post office.
Can you help me?
Sure. It's not far from here.
Just go straight down this road for about three blocks.
You'll see a bakery on your right.
The post office is right next to it,
you can't miss it.
Thank you! Do you know what time it closes?
I think it closes at 5 PM.
You should have plenty of time if you go now.
